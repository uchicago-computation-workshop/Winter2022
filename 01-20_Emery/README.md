**Summary:** In brief, I plan to provide an overview of how my team has approached social media research in the service of informing public health policy.  We have worked on a range of projects, which demanded a variety of approaches that ranged from rudimentary and fast to very complex and expensive.  This talk will briefly describe data sources, analytic approaches and findings of exemplar studies, and open discussion about current challenges we are working on.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a group comment (one post/group) on the issues <a href= https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Winter2022/issues/2> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository. We will use a rotation system for group posting. All group 1 sub-groups are expected to post a question this week, but group 2 sub-groups do not need to post. </a>
