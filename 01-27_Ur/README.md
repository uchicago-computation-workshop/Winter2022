**Summary:** Although targeted advertising has drawn significant attention from privacy researchers, many critical empirical questions remain. To develop a deeper understanding of the current targeting advertising ecosystem, we had 231 participants download their own Twitter data, containing ads they were shown and the associated targeting criteria, for measurement and to bootstrap a user study. We found many targeting mechanisms ignored by prior work — including advertiser-uploaded lists of specific users, lookalike audiences, and retargeting campaigns — are widely used on Twitter. Crucially, participants found these understudied practices among the most privacy invasive. I will discuss this project's lessons for data access rights and also discuss ongoing work focused on making companies' responses to data access requests under CCPA and GDPR more usable and useful.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a group comment (one post/group) on the issues <a href= https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Winter2022/issues/3> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository. </a> We will use a rotation system for group posting. All group 2 sub-groups are expected to post a question and attend this week, but group 1 sub-groups do not need to post and attendance is optional.
