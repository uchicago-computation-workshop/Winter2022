**Summary:** Online communication is becoming increasingly popular. However, due to the lack of regulations and low effort of this informal communication, some users try to manage their public impression by playing wording tricks during the communication (e.g., deceptive marketing), making it hard for  the audience to assess the authenticity of the messages. In this talk, I will first show the computational linguistic models developed for estimating the wording effect on audience perception. Then, I will introduce how we get inspiration from this finding to explore spurious correlations in text classification, and how we apply causal inference methodologies to improve text classifier robustness, fairness, and trustworthiness. I will conclude this talk by discussing my research interests in applying data science techniques to get insights into social issues and developing trustworthy machine learning models.

**Zhao Wang** is an assistant instructional professor in the MACSS program at the University of Chicago. Zhao's research lies at the intersection of online social network analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, and causal inference. She is interested in developing computational linguistic models to gain insights into social issues from the perspective of text and language in online communication.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a group comment (one post/group) on the issues <a href= https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Winter2022/issues/4> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository. </a> We will use a rotation system for group posting. All group 1 sub-groups are expected to post a question and attend this week, but group 2 sub-groups do not need to post and attendance is optional.
